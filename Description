ADID is a realtime and web based application developed 
for the purpose of IOT device anomaly detection. 
The system has a secure registration system powered by 
the MERN Stack and the user has upload historical and 
realtime data of any IOT device in a CSV format. 
The system will create different cards for the different 
devices and then generate information from the data as to
whether maintainence is necessary or not for a particular 
IOT device and number of anomalies recorded. The system 
also generates a graph based on the present performance 
of the device which also conveys the futuristic working 
procedures of the IOT device.
